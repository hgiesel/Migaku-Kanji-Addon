## Repo structure

There are two primary directories in the root of this repository:

1. **The `addon` folder**

The `addon` folder is basically what ends up in the Anki addon folder.

Within, there is there `addon/collection` folder, which contains the static assets used by the addon that end up in the Anki user's `collection.media` folder.

The `addon/models` folder contains the HTML and CSS used for the production and recognition note types in Anki. These files are generated by the build process in the `templates` directory, so don't edit these files directly.

The `addon/web` folders contains the files pertaining to the lookup browser, including HTML and CSS that's also generated by the `templates` directory build script.

2. **The `templates` folder**

This folder contains the source files for the HTML and CSS used in the production & recognition note types, as well as the lookup browser.

This folder is essentially its own self contained repository, so if you're interested in how it works or how to generate the templates from the source files, please read the [README.md](../templates/README.md) file in that directory.

## Development setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `bash tools/kanjivg_download.sh` to download the KanjiVG SVGs
3. Run `python tools/kanjivg_cleanup.py` delete unnecessary info from svg files so we're able to parse them
